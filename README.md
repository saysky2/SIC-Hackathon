# Dictionary App

This is a basic Dictionary Application built using Python's `tkinter` module for the GUI and `json` for saving dictionary data to a file. The app allows you to search, add, update, and delete words along with their definitions.

## Features

- **Search for a word:** Find the definition of a word in the dictionary.
- **Add a word:** Add a new word and its definition to the dictionary.
- **Update a word:** Modify the definition of an existing word.
- **Delete a word:** Remove a word from the dictionary.
- **Persistent storage:** The dictionary is saved in a `dictionary.json` file, allowing data to be retained between app runs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (usually pre-installed with Python or if not use the command: pip install tkinter as tk)
- `json` (comes with Python):
The main purpose to use .json file is because it is lightweight and and easy to read and write.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository or download the script files to your local machine.
2. Ensure that the `dictionary.json` file is in the same directory as the Python script. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.
3. Run the Python script.
